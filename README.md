### Welcome to the gitbook-setup package

To install the package you have to return
```bash
> npm install -g gitbook-setup
```

You have it to install it globally (-g option) if you want to execute the program directly on the console. To see
how to execute the command you have just to run:

```bash
> gitbook-setup [help]
```

You have now three options for creating a book:
 - Passing book configuration through arguments.
 - Giving a file with the whole configuration.
 - In interactive form. The program will ask you for all information.
